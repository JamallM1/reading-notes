- The order in which the computer executes statements in a script
- The code is ran in order from the first line in the file to the last line unless the computer changes flow
- Typically scripts in Java Script include control structures, conditionals, loops, and functions
- Look at the program structure to see how it affects order of execution

## Conditional

## Loops 

- a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is met

## Function

- Code snippet that can be called by other code or by itself, or that refers to the function
