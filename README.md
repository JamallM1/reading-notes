# Reflection #

Headings
- You have to add the number sign # in front of the word (ex: # word ) the more # signs the smaller the text is the less # sign's the bigger the text is.

Paragraphs
- You need to use a blank line to seperate one or more lines. It's very similar as typing a double space paper but you're manually entering the lines.

Emphasis
- Is adding bold text or italic text by entering (** word ** word ** for bold) and for italics it would be (A*word*word).

Block Quotes
- To create a block quote add a (>)in front of a paragraph, the block quotes are typically used for large paragraphs from other sources. 

List
- is exactly what it means,there are multiple types of list such as the ordered list which don't have to be in any order but the list typically starts with one

Code
- an enclosed word. (ex: 'this')

Horizontal Rule
- uses three or more asterisks before or after the word or phrase. (ex: ...like this)
